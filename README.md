# My-Coding-Practice
Quick walk through to the coding challenges

I'm a self-motivated coder learning web technologies online. Introduced myself to programming languaues, make use of what I learned to develop some real time projects. Now, I have enough courage to introduce myself as a Web Developer. In my last phase of job hunt, I concenterate more on coding challenges, that comes all my way as the screening in the interview processes. I somehow feel, as an entry level canditate, I should be facing interviews with some important set of problems that cover the basic data structures and algorithms. So, here we learn Data Structures and Algorithms together.
